\begin_layout Abstract
This project provides a Liferay portlet with the basic structure to create
 step based web applications.
 It will be the base for a Rapid Assessment for Markets web application
 which will help humanitarian workers to conduct market assessments in order
 to better assist disaster affected populations.
 The development has been carried out following modern software methodologies
 which provide a development and testing framework to ease further development
 and to ensure software quality objectives achievement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The humanitarian world is being increasingly specialized, and since the
 beginning of the century a significant number of tools have been being
 created in order to increase effectiveness, efficiency, impact and thereby
 quality of humanitarian assistance.
 Moreover, the empowerment of target populations has fortunately gained
 in importance, as well as the concepts of 
\emph on
dignity
\emph default
, 
\emph on
sustainable livelihoods
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
population choices
\emph default
.
 In this context, humanitarian assistance has increased its contextualization
 leaving the old-fashioned forms of charity and promoting recovery or developmen
t actions as far as possible guided by the target populations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, cash transfer interventions have acquired importance
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
According to http://www.cash-atlas.org, since XXXX to XXXX cash projects beneficia

\end_layout

\end_inset

 inasmuch as it is a tool which really empowers target population since
 they are the beneficiaries who decide their priorities to recover from
 a disaster and, with a little of guidance if necessary, can take the rains
 of their future development.
 But a cash intervention needs, inter alia, functional markets in order
 to have the intended impact, so during last years some tools have been
 created in order to better analyze markets in crisis situations, as the
 best-known EMMA

 tool to analyze markets in the emergency phase, and it is essentially derived
 from EMMA but aimed to carry out market assessments faster and reducing
 the resources costs (not only economic, but also regarding human and time).
 Despite that, difficulties have been found to spread RAM and make it available
 for a large number of volunteers and RC/RC members, so the Livelihoods
 Resources Centre (an IFRC centre whose mission is to increase awareness
 and use of effective livelihoods programming strategies within the RC/RC
 Movement) has considered necessary the creation of a web application to
 
\emph on
guide
\emph default
 through RAM and make it 
\emph on
available

 for potential practitioners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project is a

 of that web application development and it has been conducted paying close
 attention to the development process and methodology in order to ensure
 both extensibility and requirements fulfillment.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main objective of this project is to carry out the first phase of the
 development of a web tool to help practitioners to carry out Rapid Assessment
 for Markets.
 At the end of the project a working software should have been created with
 the basic structure to create on it a Rapid Assessment for Markets web
 tool which could be expanded with new features in the future.
 The real power of the web tool will lie on the possibility of following
 the RAM interactively and improve the web tool in the future to allow users
 input the data and analyze it within the tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the web tool will be hosted by the Livelihoods Resources Centre
\begin_inset Foot

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A secondary objective of the project is to create a working testing framework
 which will make easier in the future to guide the development and perform
 tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Development Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software development has intended to use the software engineering techniques
 and methodologies currently used in software business.
 As it will be shown, some of the techniques has been adopted during the
 course of the project in an effort to improve the software development
 methodology and hence software quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agile Software Development has been practiced since it, as stated in the
 
\emph on
Agile Manifesto
\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AgileManifesto"

\end_inset

, come to value some items over other ones, which has been regarded a good
 practice for this project:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:
\series default
 The fact of using methodologies oriented to individuals and interactions
 means that agile ones are less prescriptive than traditional methods, so
 it will not only facilitate the comprehension of the process by the non-technic
al stakeholders - in this case the customer -, but also will be more adaptative
 allowing to better fit the methodology to the project and team needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Working software over comprehensive documentation:
\series default
 Inasmuch as the objective of the project is to do a web tool to guide through
 Rapid Assessment for Markets, the documentation is not a main objective
 and the efforts will be aimed mostly to make a working web tool.
 In despite of this and in order to make a properly documented Final Project,
 all the development phases and sprints will be well documented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:
\series default
 Since there is not a contractual relationship with the customer and the
 requirements are not quite clear, the involvement of the customer will
 be important during the project for the purpose of assuring the software
 accomplishes the goals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Responding to change over following a plan: 
\series default
In the same vein, as the requirements and the software design were a little
 ambiguous on the customer side, changes on the fly might be done, so flexible
 methodologies were required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Implementing agile methodologies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the purpose of the project it has been founded more useful to combine
 techniques from agile (mainly Scrum
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) and Lean
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 methodologies, rather than following just one strictly.
 Therefore, the combination of several techniques allows to take the best
 of each one - as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "AndrewThuPham2012"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 - and it also allows the development methodology to be adapted to the current
 project specifications and to evolve according to the project momentum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To begin with, and in order to structure the development process, the developmen
t has been structured in 
\emph on
sprints
\emph default
 following the Scrum framework.
 In this way, the development is incremental and it allows to better being
 structured and documented.
 The process of each sprint is documented in

 and is closely linked to version control as the branching strategy defines
 the versions structure.
 For the current project, the branching strategy has not been too complex
 since branches has only been created to add new features keeping the working
 code untouched.
 In fact, in the most of the cases a new branch has been created for each
 sprint and, at the end of the sprint has been merged to the master branch.

Behavior Driven Development
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 (BDD) is a development technique built upon Test Driven Development (TDD)
 and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) and first described by Dan
 North in 2006
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "IntroBDD"

\end_inset

.
 Is has been adopted for the current project after the third sprint.
 To better understand BDD it is necessary understanding what TDD and ATDD
 are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
TDD
\series default
 is a software development process which helps creating well-written and
 working code.
 According to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Koskel2007"

\end_inset


\emph on
 TDD cycle is a three-step process of writing a test, making it pass by
 writing just enough production code, and finally improving the design by
 disciplined refactorings
\emph default
, so the three steps are testing, coding and refactoring.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:TDD_cycle"

\end_inset

 the cycle flowchart is shown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

ATDD
\series default
 is a process based in TDD but including the concept of acceptance tests
 and highlighting the customer-tester-developer collaboration
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pugh2011"

\end_inset

.
 Acceptance tests are related to the specifications and check if they are
 met, so ATDD process is similar to TDD but working the acceptance tests
 which in fact means improving the collaboration among customer, tester
 and developer since customer must be involved in acceptance tests definition.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, BDD introduces the concept of 
\emph on
behavior
\emph default
 which is a description of what the system 
\emph on
should do
\emph default
 using consistent vocabulary, so the traditional disconnect between business
 and technology disappears
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BDDWiki"

\end_inset

.
 This increases the involvement of customer in the development, so for this
 project enhances the opportunity of involvement of future users, who could
 not have a technical background.
 Thus, talking about behaviors instead of tests and writing them in a natural
 language so anyone on the team can read it, improves the communication
 and the understanding among all the stakeholders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Documentation
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Documentation"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the advantages of BDD is that tests not only check the software,
 but also document it as they are descriptions of the software behavior.
 This is very useful because all the documentation related to the software
 behavior is already written.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of that, the code should be documented in order to make easier
 the involvement of new developers in the future, so Javadoc
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Javadoc"

\end_inset

 has been used.
 Javadoc is a tool for generating code documentation by adding Java annotation
 to the code.
 The most important objects and methods in the code have been annotated
 so code will be more understandable.

\begin_layout Section
Testing Framework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it will be explained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Subsection
Quadrant 1 tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tests in Quadrant 1 are usually taken by the developers and are aimed to
 ensure the quality of small parts of the software as well as their interactions
 with other parts.
 Within the project unit tests has been automatized for some components
 as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Second-Sprint"

\end_inset

, but in many cases and due to the integration of the project in Liferay
 which will be discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Liferay"

\end_inset

, unit tests were barely taken manually during development and the effort
 has been made in the automation of next quadrants tests, which allow to
 test the correct behavior of small parts in an easier way when they are
 integrated with the whole system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the used technologies, JUnit4
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
http://junit.org/junit4/
\end_layout

\end_inset

 has been the framework chosen for unit tests, as it has a good documentations
 and xUnit is one of the most popular testing frameworks.
 In the reporting side, Allure framework
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 has been used because of the good integration with JUnit and the quality
 and customization of the reports.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quadrant 2 tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quadrant 2 comprises the Business-Facing tests which address requirements
 of the software.
 It includes all the user stories and features desired and should also check
 for undesired behavior in specific cases.
 Thus, the BDD tests are included in this quadrant.
 It is important to understand that even if BDD are acceptance tests, they
 are different to User Acceptance Tests, which will be explained in the
 next quadrant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this project, the most of the testing efforts has been made in this
 quadrant as BDD has been the main testing methodology.
 The nature of the web app, which is embedded in Liferay and uses mature
 technologies such as Java Server Faces as explained below, implies that
 the best way to test the software is when it is already embedded and working
 since the surrounding technologies are not supposed to fail.
 In this way, the testing efforts are optimized and the quality of the software
 is ensured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to implement BDD and carry out the tests, two main technologies
 have been employed in addition to the reporting

 is a framework which automates browsers.
 In the current project, the 
\emph on
Selenium WebDriver
\emph default
 has been used because it allows to create and automate tests programmatically
 through several languages, in this case the Selenium Java binding has been
 the chosen one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although many browsers are supported by 
\emph on
Selenium
\emph default
, just Mozilla Firefox and Chrome have been used.
 In fact, although Firefox was used in several tests, Chrome has been the
 main testing browser since Firefox WebDriver had some issues depending
 on the Firefox version installed in the testing machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To improve tests development and scalability a little framework has been
 created to have separately the WebDriver and the pages handling, so two
 type of objects have been created:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
DriverFactory
\family default
 This is a static object in charge of handling the WebDriver.
 This object creates and destroys the WebDriver and provides it when it
 is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter

\family default
 These objects which usually inherit from

These levels are the core of the BDD methodology because it is where the
 software behaviors are defined.
 As stated in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "subsec:Behavior-Driven-Development"

\end_inset

, behaviors are understood by customer, tester and developer so should be
 developed in close collaboration among all of them.
 Consequently, all these levels are written in a natural language so it

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But Cucumber does not has a

\emph on
Scenarios:

 Scenarios are the next level and they are akin to use cases.
 Thus, they are composed by steps and define the behavior of the system
 in a given use case.
 To concretely define the behavior, in Cucumber scenarios follow the structure

 written in Gherkin language.
\end_layout

Steps:

 The last level of the Business-Facing section are steps.
 Steps are single actions that are concatenated in Cucumber so they say
 the system 
\emph on
what

 to do.
 Each step has its step definition in the Technology-Facing section, so
 the natural language is translated into a testable language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As stated above, the main technology to power this business-facing section
 is the 
\emph on

 language as it is the language used for writing Cucumber features, scenarios
 and steps.
 It is a natural language with a specific structure and a set of keywords
 to define features, scenarios and steps.

\begin_layout Standard
This tests are oriented to critique the product when it has been already
 developed and find any unwanted behaviors usually not stipulated in the
 requirements (if BDD has been well carried out).
 That is why this tests are not automatized and require the strong involvement
 of the customer, that is what is called User Acceptance Tests which should
 not be confused with the ATDD performed in Quadrant 2.
 Also here are included usability tests with different users and real-world
 cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the project, some tests in this quadrant has been taken, but as the functiona
lities are not quite numerous, they have been just a few of manual tests
 with some members of the Livelihoods Resources Centre which have critique

 So it is important to move away from the idea that BDD does not entail
 design.
 In fact, as it will be shown in

 the latter ones are sprints aimed to clean and restructure the code so
 it is more comprehensible, its complexity is reduced and therefore maintainabil

The choice of the web framework has been taken directly by the customer.
 As explained in

\end_inset

, the final product should be a web application embedded in the Livelihoods
 Resource Centre web, so as that web has been developed with Liferay Portal
 Community Edition because of an organizational decision, there is not discussio

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Liferay Portal is an open-source enterprise portal distributed under the

.
 As it is Java-based, and even it supports plug-in extends into multiple
 programming languages, the most natural, efficient and easy to install
 and maintain is a portlet in Java, so that is why the web app has been
 developed as a Liferay portlet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Liferay Portal also provides some tools to facilitate the development.
 One of the most important ones is what is called

 Although it has some constraints as it will be shown in

\begin_layout Standard
The two main ways to create a portlet for Liferay are: a Liferay MVC portlet
 (using the Liferay MVC framework) and a Liferay JSF portlet (based on the
 JavaServer Faces specification and implementation
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
https://javaserverfaces.java.net/
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 The decision of using JSF for this project has been mainly based in the
 fact that JSF is a standard also outside Liferay, it is more modern than
 a classic JSP solution and it is a web application oriented specification.
 Liferay supports JSF 2.2 specification but for Liferay Portal 6.2 (the version
 used in the LRC web) default JSF specification is JSF 2.1, so it has been
 the version used in the development to avoid compatibility problems.

On the other hand, it is worth pointing out that JSF pages have a particular
 life cycle which should be considered when using this technology.
 As in a JSP page, when the client makes an HTTP request for the page, the
 server sends the response as the page in HTML.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A first design was drafted to make implementation easier so the JSF architecture
 was kept in mind when coding.
 As discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted

\end_inset

 we will focus in Model and View parts of a MVC architecture since the Controlle

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 JSF
\emph on

\emph default
On the one hand the model object provided by the 
\emph on

\emph default
 which represents the persistence layer.

: 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, 
\emph on
Liferay
\emph default
 provides a service to create the persistence layer, so it was used to create
 the object 
\family typewriter
Assessment 
\family default
which stores the current step of each created assessment, considering that
 this current steps does not depend on the session but is a value that must
 be saved in the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the one hand, two beans were necessary in this sprint as part of the
 model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\emph on
session scoped
\emph default
 bean to keep all the session information, which is needed to know where
 the user is, what is he doing, what are the next allowed actions, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A
\emph on
 request scoped
\emph default
 bean which will be responsible of bringing the needed information and which
 actually works as a bridge between the persistent object and the view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding to the view, namely the 
\emph on
JSF UI components
\emph default
 according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained above, for the persistence layer the Liferay Service Builder
 was used, which helps developers to code simple persistence objects which
 will work with the system relational database.
 After implementing the persistence layer, the 
\family typewriter
mainView.xhtml
\family default
 was developed.
 This allowed the developer to draft the methods which would be needed from
 the beans.
 Lastly, the two beans were coded implementing the needed methods and inheriting
 their common characteristics from a common parent 
\family typewriter

\family default
.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to implement in the future the flow chart tools within the RAM,
 a flow chart system should be developed.
 The flowchart library search didn't give results so a generic library 
\family typewriter

\family default
 was developed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the purpose explained above, four main classes were necessary, but in
 order to extend the library for future uses, a fifth class was created
 for non-strict flows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
BasicNode<T,C>
\family default
 This class is the core of the library and represents a node of the flowchart
 which is composed by a content of type 
\family typewriter
T
\family default
 and an undefined number of edges of type 
\family typewriter
C
\family default
, which in turn inherits from 
\family typewriter
Comparable
\family default
 in order to allow a flow choose among all the edges the correct one.
 This class also implements not only methods to create and destroy nodes,
 but also to find the next node in a flowchart for a given condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
BasicFlowChart<T,C>
\family default
 Composed by BasicNodes implements the methods to create, edit and destroy
 a flowchart as well as the methods to navigate through the flowchart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
Edge<T,C>
\family default
 This is just a very simple auxiliary class only used to make easier the
 construction of 
\family typewriter
BasicFlowChart
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
Flow<T,C>
\family default
 This class represents a particular flow and the flow status, that is to
 say the current node of the flow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
PermissiveFlow<T,C>
\family default
 As explained before, this class has been created just to implement non-restrict
ive flows.
 In other words, flows allowing inputs not matching any of the conditions
 of the edges of the current node, in this case the flow will remain in
 the current node.

\begin_layout Subsection
Third Sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After some interviews with the client it was concluded that the development
 is quite limited and poorly flexible since it will just fit the current
 RAM tool requisites and it would be pretty complex to extend it.
 Finally it was decided to change the requisites and develop a web tool
 flexible enough to implement different kind of methodologies or tools.
 That is how the project has become a tool builder, and so is called Toolbuilder
, and the new portlet which implements the tools is called 
\family typewriter
tool-implementation
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the 
\emph on
beans
\emph default
 and the 
\emph on
JSF views
\emph default
 remained the same, some generalization were done in the model to conform
 to the new requirements.
 The former 
\family typewriter
Assessment
\family default
 class is going to be replaced by a more complex structure:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Firstly, as there must be several kind of steps depending on the specifications
 of the tool to be created, two type of steps (classes) were created in
 this sprint which inherit from the class 
\family typewriter
Step
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
VoidStep
\family default
 Just a type of step for developing purposes without content and/or configuratio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
CompositeStep
\family default
 This is a step which contains other steps so an structure step/substep
 can be implemented following a 
\emph on
Composite Pattern
\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ErichGamma1994"

\end_inset

.
 As it should store information about the substeps it contains, it is persistent
, therefore it was created with 
\emph on
Liferay Service Builder
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Moreover, an object called 
\family typewriter
\series bold
StepFactory
\family default
\series default
 is in charge of the creation of the different steps following a 
\emph on
Factory Pattern
\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ErichGamma1994"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lastly, a new object called 
\family typewriter
\series bold
ToolInstance
\family default
\series default
 fundamentally performs the function of the former 
\family typewriter
Assessment
\family default
 object storing all the information related to the each assessment, hereafter
 called 
\emph on
tool instance
\emph default
.

Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After replacing 
\family typewriter
Assessment
\family default
 class by 
\family typewriter
ToolInstance
\family default
, the first step was to create the 
\family typewriter
Step
\family default
 class, which would be the parent of all kind of steps.
 Later a new 
\emph on
Service Builder
\emph default
 entity was created for the new 
\family typewriter
CompositeStep
\family default
 class, followed by the simple 
\family typewriter
VoidStep
\family default
 class which mocks any kind of step.
 Finally, the 
\family typewriter
StepFactory
\family default
 class was implemented to create steps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this sprint the testing framework was implemented and the Behavior Driven
 Development (BDD) was set up for next Sprints.
 Tests scenarios were developed for the three existing features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Tool Instance Creation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Navigate through steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Tool Instance Deletion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each feature, the different scenarios or user stories (in compliance
 with the BDD methodology) were created.
 The development of the tests also required some debugging, as it is shown
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:sprint3_tests_fail"

\end_inset

 the first time tests were executed there were some defects.
 After debugging it was checked that defects were caused by bugs in the
 tests, particularly by the way 
\emph on
Selenium WebElement
\emph default
s were selected because the 
\emph on
XPath
\emph default
 did not match with the web elements outputted by the portlet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fourth Sprint
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Fourth-Sprint"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As tools should be able to be customized and many occurrences of each tool
 may be created, it becomes necessary to make code refactoring in order
 to divide the two parts: 
\emph on
Tool Definitions
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Tool Instances
\emph default
.
 So after refactoring we have separately the objects related to the tool
 structure - hereafter 
\emph on
Tool Definition
\emph default
 - and the objects related to the tool occurrences - hereafter 
\emph on
Tool Instances
\emph default
.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Redesign / Refactoring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tool definitions are separated from tool instances creating two different
 classes (
\family typewriter
ToolDef
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
ToolInstance
\family default
), likewise steps definitions should be separated from step implementations,
 for that purpose abstract classes 
\family typewriter
StepDef
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Step
\family default
 were created to steps inheriting them, the first one representing the step
 definition and the second one representing the step within the 
\emph on
tool instance
\emph default
, that is to say the step occurrence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:sprint4_design"

\end_inset

, a symmetric design has been implemented which will be replicated for each
 step:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In blue the definition part, with 
\family typewriter
StepDef
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
CompositeStepDef
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
ToolDef
\family default
 classes.
 All them related to the 
\emph on
tool definitions
\emph default
 which will define the structure and configuration of each tools and each
 step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In red the instances part, with 
\family typewriter
Step
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
CompositeStep
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
ToolInstance
\family default
 classes.
 These classes represent to the status of each tool instance.
 Namely the current step for each tool instance, the status of each step
 and all the related information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we can see in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:sprint4_design"

\end_inset

, 
\emph on
Factory
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Composite Patterns
\emph default
 are still being used after refactoring.

In the same way, database needed to be redesigned in order to match with
 the new classes design.
 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:sprint4_db"

\end_inset

 there is also a symmetry between the definition part, on top, and the instances
 part.
 Each 
\emph on
Tool
\emph default
 (both definition and instance) contains a 
\emph on
Composite Step
\emph default
, which as a relationship 1 to 1 with the 
\emph on
Step
\emph default
 table (as class 
\family typewriter
CompositeStep
\family default
 inherits from 
\family typewriter
Step
\family default
) but also a relationship N to N because one 
\emph on
composite step
\emph default
 contains several 
\emph on
steps
\emph default
 and one 
\emph on
step
\emph default
 could be in several 
\emph on
composite step
\emph default
s.
 Although there is data redundancy in the N to N relationships - which in
 fact can be simplified removing the relationship between tables 
\emph on
CompositeStepDBE
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
StepDBE
\emph default
 - at this sprint it was felt useful to make easier the development of the
 associated classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, a new 
\emph on
managed bean application scoped
\emph default
 was created called 
\family typewriter
FactoryBean
\family default
.
 This bean manages and stores the different type of steps and existing tool
 definitions and it also stores the tool definition which is in use.

Test design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tests remained the same since no new user features were implemented.
 Anyhow, the test were passed to guarantee refactoring has been successful
 and accomplishes all the required features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The only aspect to note during implementation was the difficulty of working
 with 
\emph on
Liferay Service Builder (LSB)
\emph default
 and its way of supporting N to N relationships.
 After exploring how to do it the
\emph on
 
\emph default
persistent objects were created, the 
\emph on
LSB
\emph default
 allows to create N to N relationships but, as it would be realized later
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Tenth-Sprint"

\end_inset

, it is not the best option due to the poor customization allowed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fifth Sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the breakup between 
\emph on
tool definition
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
tool instance
\emph default
 it is needful to define permissions to access both areas.
 Thus, the definition should be used by tool administrators, while the instances
 should be available to logged users, but non logged users will be able
 to see tools instances not having permissions to use them.
 Therefore, the permission scheme should be defined to provide limited access
 based on user role following the scheme in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "table:sprint5_permissions"

\end_inset

.
 In addition to the 
\family typewriter
tool-implementation
\family default
 portlet, who is in charge of the tool instances, a new portlet called 
\family typewriter
tool-definition
\family default
 has been added to manage the tool definitions, it will be created in the
 next sprint.

Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To code the permission restrictions, the Liferay permissions scheme has
 been used.
 It allows to define permissions for the portlets and the model based on
 the user's role through a xml file.
 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lis:sprint5_perm"

\end_inset

, three permissions have been configured: add, delete and edit; those three
 permissions are allowed to any site member but restricted to guests, namely
 anonymous users.
 As can be noted only permissions for the 
\family typewriter
tool-implementation
\family default
 portlet were defined in this sprint, since 
\family typewriter
tool-definition
\family default
 portlet implementation will be addressed in the next sprint.

\begin_layout Standard
Once the back-end for tool definition was developed it was necessary to
 create the interface so admin users can choose between the existing tool
 definitions, therefore in this sprint the portlet

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The new portlet called 
\family typewriter
tool-definition
\family default
 was created only accessible for admin users and available through the 
\emph on
Site Administration -> Content
\emph default
 section, so the 
\family typewriter
control-panel-entry-category
\family default
 parameter was defined as 
\family typewriter
site_administration.content
\family default
.
 Thus, the permission scheme from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lis:sprint5_perm"

\end_inset

 was implemented because that section is only accessible for admin users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the current tool definition is stored in the 
\emph on
application scoped bean
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
FactoryBean
\family default
, only the view 
\family typewriter
adminView.xhtml
\family default
 needed to be developed in this sprint.
 The list of tool definitions was implemented through a 
\family typewriter
<p:datatable>
\family default
 from 
\emph on
Primefaces
\emph default
.
 Some troubles were also founded in order to refresh the page when a tool
 definition was chosen but, finally it was decided only to render again
 the form the button was embedded in, though an 
\emph on
Ajax
\emph default
 call.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to have different views for tool definition choosing and tool definitio
n edition, a new 
\family typewriter
toolDefConfig.xhtml
\family default
 file was created which is called to configure the tool definitions.
 In this case, the name of the tool to work with is passed as part of the
 URL (using 
\family typewriter
GET
\family default
 method instead of 
\family typewriter
POST
\family default
) so the page can be addressed straight away by any admin user foreseeing
 a future option of create a tool definition from other different page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, a way to show different step definitions should be defined,
 so a tabs view was used due to the familiarity of users with this kind
 of interface and the easiness of development provided by the Primefaces
 
\family typewriter
tabView
\family default
 resource.
\end_layout

Finally, it was necessary to develop two new managed beans, colored in blue

 It is a

 the name - check if it is not void or if it already exists, so it prevents
 database exceptions - and to create the URL to create the new tool definition.

Eighth Sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An interface to add steps to the tool definition should be created so after
 creating a new tool definition, admin users were able to add different
 steps and give content to the tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Test Design
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact of adding steps to a new tool definition was considered as part
 of the behavior 
\emph on
Create Tool Definition
\emph default
, so some new scenarios were appended to the existing feature.
 There were some issues when coding the steps since, as it is explained
 in the next implementation section, the used framework creates a new 
\family typewriter
<iframe>
\family default
 for a new dialog; this implied that the elements were not founded by the
 
\emph on
Selenium WebDriver
\emph default
.
 Finally it was fixed when finding out that 
\emph on
Selenium WebDriver
\emph default
 defines the 
\family typewriter
iframe
\family default
 which is working in, so if it changes it should be switched - calling the
 method 
\family typewriter
driver.switchTo.frame()
\family default
 - in order to allow the driver to find those elements.

\begin_layout Standard
The new view should be embedded in the

 also to add steps to any of the nested composite steps.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to have an independent view which could be embedded, the 
\emph on
Primefaces Dialog Framework
\emph default
 was used so a new view called 
\family typewriter
selectStepDefDialog.xhtml
\family default
 was created and it is shown as a dialog (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:sprint8_dialog"

\end_inset

) when the user is going to create a new step definition.
 Thus, the choice of the new step type is made by the user in this new dialog,
 which returns it (the step type) to 
\family typewriter
toolDefConfig.xhtml
\family default
 via 
\family typewriter
POST
\family default
 method.
 The 
\emph on
Primefaces Dialog Framework
\emph default
 creates a new 
\family typewriter
<iframe>
\family default
 and embeds the new view, so it is completely independent and it allows
 to call the view from other different pages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other side, the view 
\family typewriter
toolDefConfig.xhtml
\family default
 was modified to show the created steps, the chosen method to do that was
 using the 
\emph on
Primefaces
\emph default
 
\family typewriter
<p:tabview>
\family default
 tag as the tab interface uses to be familiar to users.

After creating tool steps, next needed feature was to delete tool step definitio
ns, which is addressed in this sprint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Test Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The step definition deletion operation is made from the 
\family typewriter
toolDefConfig.xhtml
\family default
 and should consider some different cases: from one to several steps deletion
 and from an already existing or a new tool definition.
 Therefore, four cases were designed which, as shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sprint9_tests"

\end_inset

, were successfully passed.
 There were some code refining when testing, since the processing of deletion
 should depend on the load onto the database of newly created step definitions.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implementation of this sprint has been done through the attribute 
\family typewriter
closable
\family default
 of the tab elements which executes and 
\emph on
Ajax
\emph default
 call when the 
\family typewriter
tabClose
\family default
 event triggers, so the 
\emph on
Ajax
\emph default
 call was defined to delete the register of the persistence layer.
 The only difficulties founded, as explained in the test design, were regarding
 the different cases related to the database load, the system should ensure
 the closed tab had been created in the database before proceeding to delete
 it from the database, so it should be considered if a tab was just created
 before deleting it.
 Finally, after the testing process all issues were solved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tenth Sprint
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Tenth-Sprint"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, and due to an interview with the client, it was realized
 that steps order should be able to be modified within the tool definition
 configuration.
 Up to this moment, steps were added in consecutive order, from first to
 last, so if users wanted to modify the order the only way was deleting
 existing steps and creating them again.
 To develop this new feature it was necessary to modify the back-end since
 the model did not support steps order, so a refactoring was addressed in
 this sprint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Test Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tests for this sprint are the same tests that had already been passed but
 checking if the database was also storing and deleting the new added step
 order.
 To do that, the 
\family typewriter
java.sql
\family default
 library was used and, instead of creating new integration tests which would
 entail a lot of work to deal with mocks, an 
\family typewriter
assert
\family default
 check was included in the step definition in the already existing and passed
 tests of the eighth sprints.
 All the database communication was managed by the new class 
\family typewriter
DBChecker
\family default
, so the testing framework was updated as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:testing_framework2"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, it was checked if the new database registers regarding the step
 order were created.

\begin_layout Standard
The database update implied, as showed in

\end_inset

, merely adding a step order field in the N to N relationships between 
\family typewriter
CSDef_StepDef
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
CS_Step
\family default
 tables.
 The problem arose when trying to do it through the 
\emph on
Liferay Service Builder
\emph default
 
\emph on
(LSB)
\emph default
, after some researching and attempts it was clear that it was not supported.
 So finally the 
\emph on
LSB
\emph default
 feature to create N to N relationships was not used, and the relationships
 tables were created just any other table with 
\emph on
LSB
\emph default
 and adding the new 
\family typewriter
stepIndex
\family default
 field.

As the database was modified, the related methods for adding and removing
 were also modified to include the new field.
 Also two new methods to update the relationship called 
\family typewriter

\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
saveNewStepsOrder
\family default
 were created to implement the new feature in the back-end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Eleventh Sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the back-end supports steps order it was time to modify the interface
 so admin users can change the order of the steps in a tool definition.
 It involved looking the possibilities of doing it in a user-friendly drag-and-d
rop way with the current tabs view.
 Given the impossibility of doing that with the existing Primefaces 
\family typewriter
<p:tab />
\family default
 tag, the whole steps interface was redesigned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Test Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tests for this sprint are those to move the steps but with regression tests
 from eighth sprint in order to assure the proper functioning of the redesigned
 interface.
 Some tests were developed for this feature, from simple steps sorting one
 step to more complex sort actions involving several steps.
 There were found difficulties to drag and drop thorough the Selenium API
 as it does not do it in a graphic way, so it did not trigger the events
 properly.
 Then a different solution was adopted with the Java Robot object (
\family typewriter
java.awt.Robot
\family default
), which worked perfectly to drag and drop the objects simulating the user
 actions.
 As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sprint11_tests"

\end_inset

, eight different cases were tested.

Implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As explained, the implementation of this feature involved changing the step
 definitions interface.
 From a tabs system it was changed to a panels system where panels (which
 are indeed steps containers) could be moved so their order was changed.
 Creating and deleting steps features remained the same since the Primefaces
 panels have also a 
\family typewriter
closable
\family default
 property.
 To save the new order a save-order-steps button was added, so if not pressed
 the new order is not stored in the database.
 In the new interface is shown.

\begin_layout Subsection
Twelfth Sprint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this moment, client and developer realized that it was not possible to
 delete Tool Definitions and it could be needed, so this feature should
 be added.
 Also it was necessary to avoid the user to delete or edit tool definitions
 which are selected or which have already created tool instances so there
 were some restrictions which should be added.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Test Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the BDD methodology, the behaviors were designed for both features
 in order to create their corresponding tests:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Deleting A delete button exists for each tool definition so when the user
 clicks on it a dialog to confirm will appear, if it is confirmed the tool
 definition will disappear from the view.
 To check if it was been also deleted in the database the previously created
 
\family typewriter
DBChecker
\family default
 object was used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
Restricting When a tool definition is selected or it has created tool instance
 it will be impossible to delete or edit it.
 So buttons should be disabled and a tool-tip will showed when moving the
 mouse over them.
 Four scenarios were created for this feature: three for the cases of not
 allowing edit or deletion and one where the system must allows it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sprint12_tests"

Implementation
\end_layout

Coding the delete button only required adding a new button to each row of
 the 
\family typewriter
<p:dataTable>
\family default
 inside a
\family typewriter
dminView.xhtml
\family default
.
 That button calls the 
\family typewriter
removeToolDef(String toolDefName)
\family default
 function from the 
\family typewriter
FactoryBean
\family default
 object, which is responsible of calling the persistent object and all the
 steps to ensure their deletion.

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the restrictions, they were implemented disabling the corresponding
 button whether the tool definition is selected or it has existing tool
 instances, it done through the Primefaces

 property.
 Also a tool-tip was added when the mouse is over a disabled button to show
 why it has been disabled.
 One found issue was that the Primefaces tool-tip implementation did not
 work properly if was linked to 
\family typewriter
commandButton
\family default
, so finally it was attached to a new div which contains all the buttons
 so the result is the same.

Results and Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the end of this project, a working and tested first phase of a Liferay
 portlet to guide through the RAM has been developed.
 This portlet provides a recurrent structure which will allow to develop
 the necessary steps and substeps to create not only a web application to
 guide through RAM, but also through any other tool structured in - sequential
 or not - steps and substeps.
 Thus, the scalability of the software has been increased following the
 customer's modifications during the project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it can be noted in the development process (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Development"

\end_inset

), a large proportion of the developing efforts have been aimed to create
 an administration portlet to configure the web tool.
 It will be this portlet, when customized steps are developed, which allows
 users to create their own web applications to guide through different processes
 or tools.
 This has become particularly relevant during the project because the applicatio
n has been redesigned to be useful not only for a RAM web tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially for testing purposes but also to make easier the development of
 the steps, a mock step has been included which can be used as a template
 for new steps development.
 This mock step has been well documented and it has the required structure
 for the new steps to be included in the system along with the different
 methods needed.
 Also a guide for developers has been included in Appendix A: 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Guide-to-develop"

\end_inset

.
 In this way, it is intended to facilitate the extension of the web tool
 through the creation of new step types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Concerning the methodology, adopting new techniques has required an extra
 effort and time in setting-up frameworks and procedures.
 Undoubtedly it has been worth in order to improve the development methodology
 and hence the quality, scalability and future development opportunities,
 but it has also implied changes and adaptations during the development
 which led to a learning process and an effort to change procedures.
 With a view to future projects, it would be desirable to establish methodology
 and processes at the beginning of the project in order to well set-up the
 development framework and avoid on the fly changes which contribute to
 slow down the development.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the biggest issue in the development process has been
 the estimation of the time needed to develop each of the sprints, that
 has usually been too optimistic.
 In addition to the code refining in order to solve bugs found in the testing
 process, which finally took longer than expected, it has also been necessary
 in many cases to improve the knowledge about the technology, either Primefaces,
 JSF or even Liferay itself.
 Moreover the tests development, particularly the Selenium support code
 and the web elements management, demanded also more time than expected.
 To sum up, roughly the 50% of the time has been used in development the
 web application and the other half of the time has been invested in setting
 up the testing framework and testing itself.
 It is difficult to estimate the time spent on the project as it has been
 discontinued and shared with other works, so another lesson learned is
 the usefulness of maintaining a time log which could be easily implemented
 if using time management techniques such as 
\emph on
Pomodoro
\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cirillo2009"

\end_inset

.
 Since it has been introduced lately in the project, the estimation of the
 time spent has been done using those late sprints, which could have been
 about 40 hours each sprint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding to the quality assurance, the testing framework which has been
 created and the fact of using a test-first methodology were aimed to offer
 a significant degree of quality, ensuring the customer requirements are
 accomplished without errors.
 This test-first methodology (particularly BDD as explained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Behavior-Driven-Development"

\end_inset

) has entailed a mind change in the way the development process is conceived.
 Since the test are developed before coding, the accomplishment of functional
 requirements is the core, and code is developed without such a deep previous
 thinking as it is done using cascade classic methodologies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially, that way of developing can cast doubts if we are used to classical
 approaches, but when you begin coding you realize that is a much more effective
 method.
 Regarding the doubts cast about how good designed can be a software developed
 in this way I have realize two main things: the first is that indeed design
 is thought before coding even if it is minimal, but you think at the design
 also when you create tests, so it is not just coding in an unstructured
 way.
 The second one is that, when some code is not as readable or structured
 as necessary, a refactoring process can be done in order to improve it
 and reduce complexity, so code remains structured and intelligible.
 Particularly in this project, creating symmetric structures when refactoring
 has simplified the design and made it more comprehensible, as shown in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Fourth-Sprint"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:Step-structure"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also worth pointing out that tests related to Quadrant 4 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Quadrant-4-tests"

\end_inset

) have not been carried out.
 But it does not mean that characteristics associated to Quadrant 4 have
 not been considered.
 In fact compatibility have been always kept in mind in the choice of the
 technologies from the general aspects (creating a Liferay portlet) to the
 more specific ones (creating interfaces with Primefaces).
 Also reliability has been always considered by improving tests, both automated
 and human guided ones.
 And of course scalability which, as it has been explained , has been one
 of the main goals of the project.
 Lastly and for the future, performance tests should been carried out in
 order to find improvements, but it has not been an objective in this first
 phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the end of the project it is possible to state that it has provided a
 functional quality software which fits the requirements of the customer.
 The created software will allow to develop any kind of steps to create
 web applications to guide through any tool or process structured in steps
 and substeps.
 So it can not only be RAM, but also many others humanitarian methodologies
 as EMMA or HES

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the objectives of the project have been achieved as a
 result of using adequate developing technologies which involve the customer
 and ensure their requirements are kept as the core of the project, in addition
 to implement quality assurance; particularly important as this point is
 the choice of adequate technologies which can make the software usable
 by the customer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So finally, a learning process has been carried out during the project which
 have resulted in a useful software and a working framework to scale it
 in the future and to carry on with the development.

Technologies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the portlet has been developed using JSF 2.1, the standard JSF version
 for Liferay 6.2, the steps should also be developed with JSF 2.1.
 It is recommended the previous reading of the Liferay tutorial

Step structure
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
MOCK
\family default
 step can be used as a template to create new steps since it is well documented
 and commented to make easier the development of new steps.
 It can be downloaded from the github repository.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core of new step structure must follow the general structure designed
 for all the portlet, that is to say a symmetric structure comprised of
 the step definition part and the step instance part:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The
\series bold
 step definition 
\series default
regards all those options and configurations defined when creating the tool
 and including the step, namely in the 
\family typewriter
tool-definition
\family default
 portlet created in the 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "subsec:Sixth-Sprint"

\end_inset

.
 For example, if we create a generic step to attach files the step definition
 may allow to define a text to show in the step like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Add files for...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the max number of files which can be added in the step.
 It should be a class inheriting from 
\family typewriter
StepDef
\family default
 class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\series bold
step instance
\series default
 regards all those options or actions that can be taken when the user access
 the step in the 
\family typewriter
tool-implementation
\family default
 portlet.
 For example in the previous case of a step to attach files, the step instance
 will manage the specific files added for a step in a particular tool instance.
 It should be a class inheriting from 
\family typewriter
Step
\family default
 class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two classes should be packaged as 
\family typewriter
org.lrc.liferay.toolbuilder.steps.XXX
\family default
, where XXX is the name of the step, and should connect with the persistent
 layer, to be consistent with the rest of the portlet it is recommended
 to build the persistent layer with 
\emph on
Liferay Service Builder
\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides the two core classes, some backing beans may be needed for the views.
 It is recommended to use 
\emph on
View Scoped
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
Request Scoped 
\emph default
beans and if some variable is needed to persist during the session save
 it in the 
\family typewriter
ToolSession
\family default
 bean, which is the 
\emph on
Session Scoped
\emph default
 bean and can be accessed from any other bean as a JSF 
\family typewriter
ManagedProperty
\family default
.
 It is important to note that all beans inherit from 
\family typewriter
AbstractBaseBean
\family default
.
 To maintain consistency with the rest of the portlet these beans should
 be packaged as org.lrc.liferay.toolbuilder.bean.steps.XXX, where XXX is the name
 of the step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, and related to the views, at least two views should be
 created: one regarding the step definition and other one regarding step
 instance.
 By convention they should be located in the directory 
\family typewriter
WEB-INF/views/steps/XXX/
\family default
 under the docroot, where XXX is - again - the name of the step.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is shown a diagram of the classes and views which may be developed, in
 blue those classes related to the step definition and in red those ones
 related to the step instance.
